# Enhancing-Flower-image-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

In this flower classification project, we employ deep learning, specifically using the ResNet architecture, to classify flowers into "roses" and "daisies." This covers preprocessing techniques, morphological transformations, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning and conduct ablation experiments to fine-tune the model's performance. The ability to efficiently classify flowers not only introduces key methodologies but also lays the foundation for broader applications in image recognition and categorization, benefiting various domains such as agriculture, healthcare, and botany.

Welcome to the module Convolutional Neural Networks - Industry Applications. Let's first talk about what you are going to learn in the upcoming sessions.

Objectives of this session
Here is a quick run-through of the broad learning objectives of this session:

You will get a hands-on experience in building an end-to-end pipeline for training CNNs. This is almost exactly how you would do this in a production environment. You are provided code throughout this session. We urge you to try experimenting with this code - it's the best way to make yourselves proficient in image processing techniques.

We will spend a good amount of time on data preprocessing techniques commonly used with image processing. This is because preprocessing takes about 50-80% of your time in most deep learning projects, and knowing some useful tricks will help you a lot in your projects. We will first use the flowers dataset from Kaggle to demonstrate the key concepts. Later, we will apply the same techniques on Chest X-ray images. The purpose of starting with the flowers dataset is to understand the process using images that you understand before getting into medical images.
Eventually, we will build a classifier - for both the Flowers and X-ray datasets. We'll take you through the important steps and hyperparameters involved in this process.

This session is divided into two parts:

Flower classification: First, we will see how to classify flowers them into “roses” and “daisies”. This is a toy dataset and its purpose is to introduce you to the key concepts and methodologies. In this session, you will learn:

How to set-up an end-to-end pipeline for training deep learning models

Preprocessing techniques: Morphological transformations etc.

Data augmentation using data generators

Building a network: Ablation experiments, hyperparameter tuning, storing the best model in disk etc.
